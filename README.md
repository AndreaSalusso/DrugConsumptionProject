# Drug Consumption Project
This projectâ€™s goal is to analyse the factors that influence drug consumption between different age groups and countries. 
The widespread concern about the use of illicit drugs has to take into consideration health, educational, individual's background and influence of other people.

The misuse of drugs can cause shifts in a person's behaviour and leads to the inability to control the use and the dosage, raising mental and physical problems.

As time passes the individual may need to increase the dosage and find it extremely difficult to go without the drug. What we did is an analysis on the drug consumption connected to parameters such as education, starting age of use and personality.
